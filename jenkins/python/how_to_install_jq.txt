Installing jq (Required for Gate Summaries)
What is jq?
    jq is a small command-line tool that reads JSON and prints only what matters.

We use it so you don’t have to:
    scroll through walls of JSON
    guess what failed
    panic at noise

If you can install jq, you can operate professionally.

Step 1: Check if jq is already installed

Run:
    jq --version

If you see something like: jq-1.6

  You’re done. Skip the rest. Go on a date with Lizzo

If you see:
  command not found
    
Then Continue below.

macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon)
Option A: Homebrew (recommended)

If you have Homebrew:

    brew install jq

Verify: 
    jq --version

Option B: No Homebrew (manual)--> If you enjoy pain and suffering.

  curl -L -o jq https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases/latest/download/jq-macos-universal
    chmod +x jq
    sudo mv jq /usr/local/bin/

Verify: 
    jq --version


  Ubuntu / Debian Linux

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y jq

Verify: 
    jq --version

  Windows (WSL required)

Important:
If you are using Windows, you must be inside WSL (Ubuntu) for this class.

Inside WSL:

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y jq

Verify: 
    jq --version

  If installation fails (do not panic)

If jq is not installed:
    Your gates still run
    Your pipeline still works
    You just won’t get the clean summary view

You can still pass the lab.
But installing jq makes your life much easier.

Then do this 

./run_all_gates.sh
./rollup_gates.sh
./summarize_gates.sh

You should see:
    a short summary
    a clear list of failures (or none)
    no guessing

That’s not a trick.
That’s how professionals work.
