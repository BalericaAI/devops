In a Jenkins stage:

./run_all_gates.sh
echo "Badge: $(cat badge.txt)"
cat pr_comment.md

Exit code will automatically fail the build if it returns 2.

Notes (SEIR reality)

first_seen_utc persists locally in .gate_state/.

In Jenkins, this persistence only works if the workspace is preserved between runs.
If your agents are ephemeral, you’ll want to store this in S3 or a small key-value store later (easy upgrade).
